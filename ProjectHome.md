# Short Description #
a Tennis Ladder championship management application for stephen leacock tennis club
> by _Will Han_

# History #
Stephen Leacock tennis club is a tennis club in Toronto Canada, the ladder tournament is one of our most popular activity in the club.It's a Pyramid-shaped  ladder consist with multiple levels and each level holds different number of tennis teams, the ladder allows teams to challenge above and at the end of the season the team at the top of the ladder will become the champion.Before we use a Excel speadsheet and lots of manual works (sending email) to manage the ladder, in 2009 a small grails app which having all core functions(report match & generate ladder position) was created and the ladder was run under it very successfully. In 2010, I decided it's time to move the ladder online.

# Introduction #

The biggest advantage for moving it online is TO LET USER **report result online** instead of sending emails, once user reported result, everyone will be able to see the standing change right away as well as the result report, so no need to wait for 'weekly' result anymore, in another words, the ladder will be 'realtime' once it's been moved online.


# Details #

A 'realtime' ladder will also show who's taken challenge, who's available for challenge at realtime, so that the ladder could 'manage' by itself.

I break down the functions into 3 phases:

  1. release 1: player registration , basic messaging. (on April 16)
  1. release 2: realtime ladder, match result list, challenger issue challenge, defender accept challenge and winner report result (aim for MAY 10)
  1. release 3: enhancement: email notifying, and on going enhancement (TBD)

To the end users they can benefit from all these above and no more efforts will be made than before. I also have backup plans if the online plan fails, we can just keep the way it was running last year.
